Export as PNG with transparency for easy placement over brand‑colored shapes in slides/LMS.
Keep a consistent color palette (e.g., blazer #2F3A4A, shirt #7EB6E8, pants #6E7175, skin #A7673E) so Susan stays on‑brand across modules. Save a seed/prompt preset for exact character consistency in future scenes (e.g., “Susan at a podium,” “Susan pointing at a chart,” etc.).
